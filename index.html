    <p>I am computer science major and this is my 5th semester in BYUI.</p>
    <p>I love traveling the world, cooking, listening to music, watching movies and anime, and working out.</p>
    <p>I am currently single. However, this status "might" change throughout the semester... We will see.</p>    
    <p>I think being able to create your own web page is very useful skill to have. In the future, I want to do my own business, and I know this skill will help me a ton.</p>    
    <p>I have been a member of the Church my whole life. I really like the scripture verse in Moroni 7:43 "...he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart."</p>
    <p>I am really excited to take this class!</p>
